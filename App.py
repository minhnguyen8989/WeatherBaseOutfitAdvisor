Description: This program helps users decide what to wear based on the current weather conditions.
            The user is prompted to input the current temperature (in Fahrenheit), the type of weather
            (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy), and wind speed (in mile/h). The program validates the inputs to ensure
            they are within a reasonable range. It then converts the temperature to Celsius and uses that,
            along with weather type and wind speed, to determine a suitable outfit. The program outputs a
            personalized outfit suggestion based on the conditions.
User Input:
    - Temperature in Fahrenheit (Float)
    - Weather type (String: sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.)
    - Wind speed in mile/h (Float)
Program Output:
    - Display of the entered weather conditions (in both °F and °C)
    - Suggested outfit based on the weather and wind conditions
